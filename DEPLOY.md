# Deploy — E-ZONE Therapists

Two independent deploy paths. They are **not** connected — a change can touch one,
the other, or both.

| Layer | What runs it | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node/Express + frontend** (`server.js`, `public/**`) | Railway | Railway auto-deploys the connected branch (`claude/inspiring-tesla-jipobw`, per `EZONE-ECOSYSTEM-STATUS.md`). |
| **Apps Script backend** (`apps-script/**`) | GitHub Actions → clasp | Push to `claude/inspiring-tesla-jipobw` that touches `apps-script/**` (see below). |

---

## Automatic Apps Script deployment (clasp in CI)

**Workflow:** [`.github/workflows/deploy-apps-script.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-apps-script.yml)

### What it does

On every push to **`claude/inspiring-tesla-jipobw`** that changes `apps-script/**`
(or `.clasp.json` / the workflow itself), CI:

1. Installs `@google/clasp` (pinned to `3.3.0`).
2. Writes `~/.clasprc.json` from the **`CLASPRC_JSON`** secret (OAuth tokens).
3. `clasp push -f` — uploads `apps-script/Code.gs` + `apps-script/appsscript.json`
   to the Apps Script project (Script ID lives in [`.clasp.json`](.clasp.json)).
4. `clasp deploy -i <DEPLOYMENT_ID>` — publishes a **new version of the existing
   deployment**. Because the deployment ID is reused, **the `/exec` URL never
   changes**, so the outpatient / dashboard consumers keep working.

This is the CI equivalent of the long-standing manual rule from
`EZONE-ECOSYSTEM-STATUS.md`:

> Deploy a **NEW VERSION of the EXISTING deployment** — never a new deployment
> (a new deployment changes the URL and breaks consumers).

The workflow **fails loudly and early** (before touching the live deployment) if
either secret is missing or if `CLASPRC_JSON` is not valid JSON.

### ⚠️ After this PR merges, CI will fail until you add two secrets

The workflow cannot authenticate to Google without them. Add both, then re-run the
failed job (or push any `apps-script/**` change).

---

## One-time setup

### 1. `CLASPRC_JSON` — the clasp OAuth credentials

On your own machine (one time), log clasp into the Google account that **owns the
Apps Script project**:

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp@3.3.0
clasp login
```

> **Version alignment matters.** CI installs **clasp `3.3.0`**, and clasp 3.x's
> `~/.clasprc.json` is a different (per-user-keyed) format than clasp 2.x. Log in
> with a **3.x** clasp so the credential file CI writes is one CI can read. If you
> ever see `Error retrieving access token: Cannot read properties of undefined
> (reading 'access_token')` in the deploy log, it means the secret was produced by
> a mismatched clasp major — re-login with `@google/clasp@3.3.0` and re-copy.

`clasp login` opens a browser, you approve, and it writes your OAuth tokens to
**`~/.clasprc.json`**. Copy that file's **entire contents** into the secret:

```bash
cat ~/.clasprc.json      # macOS/Linux
# then copy the whole JSON blob
```

On **Windows (PowerShell)**: `Get-Content "$HOME\.clasprc.json" -Raw | Set-Clipboard`.

> The account you `clasp login` with must have **edit** access to the Script ID in
> `.clasp.json`. If you can open the project in the Apps Script editor and deploy
> it manually, you have the right account.

### 2. `DEPLOYMENT_ID` — the existing Web App deployment

In the Apps Script editor for **E-ZONE Therapists**:

1. **Deploy → Manage deployments**.
2. Find the **active Web App** deployment (the one whose `/exec` URL is the app's
   `SHEETS_URL` — the one consumers already use).
3. Copy its **Deployment ID** — a long string that starts with `AKfyc…`.
   (This is *not* the `/exec` URL and *not* the Script ID.)

Reusing this ID is what keeps the URL stable. **Do not** create a new deployment.

> **Paste exactly the `AKfyc…` ID — nothing else.** If clasp reports
> `Invalid deployment ID`, the secret is wrong: it's usually the `/exec` URL, the
> Script ID, or has stray quotes/whitespace. To list the real IDs, run
> `clasp list-deployments` locally (or read the deploy job's failure output — the
> workflow prints the deployment list when the ID is rejected). Pick the AKfyc… id
> of the Web App deployment whose `@<version>` is your live one.
>
> Note: clasp 3.x can print `Invalid deployment ID` and still exit 0. The workflow
> guards against this — it requires clasp's `Deployed …@<version>` confirmation and
> fails loudly otherwise, so a rejected ID can never pass as a green (no-op) deploy.

### 3. Add both as GitHub repository secrets

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** (or, with the
GitHub CLI, `gh secret set NAME`):

| Secret name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLASPRC_JSON` | full contents of `~/.clasprc.json` |
| `DEPLOYMENT_ID` | the `AKfyc…` deployment ID |

That's it. The next push to `claude/inspiring-tesla-jipobw` touching
`apps-script/**` deploys automatically.

---

## Refreshing the token (when CI auth starts failing)

clasp OAuth tokens can expire or be revoked. When the deploy job fails at the
`clasp push`/`clasp deploy` step with an auth error, refresh the secret:

```bash
clasp login          # re-authenticate in the browser
cat ~/.clasprc.json  # copy the fresh contents
```

Update the **`CLASPRC_JSON`** secret with the new contents, then re-run the failed
job. Nothing else changes — the Script ID and `DEPLOYMENT_ID` stay the same.

---

## Security notes

- Credentials live **only** in GitHub Secrets (`CLASPRC_JSON`, `DEPLOYMENT_ID`).
  They are never committed and never printed by the workflow.
- `~/.clasprc.json` and `.clasprc.json` are in [`.gitignore`](.gitignore); the
  workflow also `rm`s the runner's copy at the end of the job (`if: always()`).
- The Script ID in `.clasp.json` is **not** a secret — it is only an identifier and
  is useless without the OAuth token.
- Never paste token contents into `Code.gs`, the README, a changelog, a commit
  message, or a PR — secrets belong only in the GitHub Secrets store.

---

## The committed `appsscript.json` is the source of truth

`clasp push -f` **overwrites** the project's manifest with
[`apps-script/appsscript.json`](apps-script/appsscript.json). The committed file
therefore *is* the live Web App configuration:

```json
"webapp": { "executeAs": "USER_DEPLOYING", "access": "ANYONE_ANONYMOUS" }
```

- `executeAs: USER_DEPLOYING` = "Execute as: **Me**".
- `access: ANYONE_ANONYMOUS` = "**Anyone**" (anonymous, no Google sign-in) — this is
  required because the consumers call the `/exec` URL server-to-server with no auth.

> **Before the first CI deploy**, confirm this matches the project's current
> settings (Apps Script editor → Deploy → Manage deployments → the Web App). If the
> live project differs, run `clasp pull` locally and commit the real manifest first
> — otherwise the first push silently rewrites the deployment's access/timezone.
> Flipping access off "Anyone" is a known way to break every consumer (they'd get
> Google's HTML sign-in page → "Non-JSON from Apps Script").

---

## Script Properties (Apps Script project settings)

Set in the Apps Script editor → Project Settings → Script Properties (they are
never in code; the full cross-app list lives in `EZONE-ECOSYSTEM-STATUS.md` and
the header comment of `apps-script/Code.gs`). Added for the staffing roster
sync:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `STAFFING_SHEETS_URL` | the ezone-staffing Apps Script `/exec` URL |
| `STAFFING_THERAPISTS_SECRET` | the shared `getTherapistsForTherapists` secret (= staffing's `THERAPISTS_READ_SECRET`) |

The Therapists roster's **source of truth is the ezone-staffing app** (workers
with role מטפל/ת) — `_getData` syncs the Therapists sheet from the feed on
every load. Until both properties are set, the sync reports `unconfigured` and
nothing is written — the last-synced list keeps being served (fail-soft for
reads, no writes; the fetch itself FAILS CLOSED, same as the debt-status
pattern).

---

## Manual fallback (if CI is unavailable)

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp@3.3.0
clasp login
clasp push -f
clasp deploy -i <DEPLOYMENT_ID> -d "manual deploy"   # `deploy` is a 3.x alias of `create-deployment`
```

Run from the repo root (where `.clasp.json` lives). Same effect as CI: new version
of the existing deployment, same `/exec` URL.
